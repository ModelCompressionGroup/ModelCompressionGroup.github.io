## Problem
General Motors (GM), one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers, operates over 140 sites involved in the manufacture and assembly of automobiles, containing 40 million assets. An example of the asset-intensive nature of the automotive industry is a single assembly line paint shop that costs $500 million, contains thousands of assets, requires upgrades every few years, and has an expected life of 35 years. However, GM grappled with frequent and unexpected equipment breakdowns in their production facilities, leading to significant downtime, substantial delays in the manufacturing process, and escalating maintenance costs. For example, the maintenance in machinery and equipment (M&E) costs GM more than $1 billion in 2018, which is more than 13% of the annual expense in M&E. The root of the problem lay in their reliance on traditional maintenance methods, which were inherently reactive. Instead of predicting and preventing equipment failures, GM often responded to issues only after they had disrupted the production flow. This reactive approach was not only costly but also inefficient, as it often led to extended periods of downtime and production delays. The need for a more proactive and efficient maintenance strategy was evident.

## Pain Point
The unplanned downtime created by these unexpected breakdowns had a cascading effect on GM’s production ecosystem. Production schedules were thrown off balance, leading to vehicle assembly and delivery delays. This disruption increased operational expenses and threatened GM’s ability to meet market demand and maintain its reputation for reliability. The inefficiency of traditional maintenance strategies, which involved scheduled checks and repairs, failed to address the problem effectively. These strategies did not account for the variable conditions under which machinery operated, often leading to maintenance being either too late or unnecessarily early, thereby wasting resources.

## Value of Edge AI
An edge AI company stepped in, offering a transformative solution through real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. Unlike traditional methods, edge AI operates directly on the production floor, where it can process data instantaneously. By deploying edge AI, GM could continuously monitor the health of their machinery through a network of sensors that capture critical data points, such as temperature, vibration, and pressure. The AI system analyzes this data in real time, using advanced algorithms to detect patterns and anomalies that indicate potential equipment failures. This proactive approach not only allows GM to foresee equipment issues before they escalate into serious problems, but also provides a sense of security and stability, minimizing unexpected breakdowns.

## Solution
Recognizing the potential of this technology, GM implemented an edge AI system across their manufacturing plants to understand the asset health. This system was designed to collect and analyze sensor data from machinery in real time. The edge AI solution provided GM with a predictive maintenance framework, where the AI could predict when specific maintenance tasks were needed based on the real-time condition of the equipment. For instance, if the AI detected abnormal vibration patterns in a critical machine, it could alert maintenance teams to perform a check before a breakdown occurred. This preemptive intervention capability not only significantly enhanced GM’s maintenance strategy, but also empowered the workers, making them feel more in control and effective.

## Outcome
The impact of integrating edge AI into GM’s maintenance operations was profound. By leveraging predictive maintenance, GM drastically reduced instances of unexpected equipment downtime by 15%. The predictive maintenance helped maintain smooth production schedules and led to substantial millions of maintenance cost savings. The reduction in downtime meant that GM could produce vehicles more efficiently, meeting market demands more reliably. Moreover, the improved maintenance efficiency contributed to the longevity of their equipment, further optimizing operational costs. Overall, deploying edge AI transformed GM’s production capabilities, enhancing its competitive edge in the automotive industry through improved efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
